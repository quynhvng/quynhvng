Hi! 👋 My name is Quỳnh. I like to work with numbers and to solve problems.
I took accounting in university but it turned out to be rather boring, after which I tried my hand at coding.

👐 Jack of many trades, master of absolutely none | 📖 Trying to study German more consistently | 
🌱 Also interested in environmental issues and other various arts and crafts (though I mostly watch)
